Medium and long-term effects such as droughts and heat waves are represented here by a merciless sun that can literally pulverize people. This narrative sledgehammer is countered by the individual characters and their interaction with the world. In a short time, players witness how people stop dreaming, how they project their fears and how their facades crumble in the face of impending doom. All this happens in such a poetic way that it makes you ache.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/game-curator.com\/miscellaneous\/goty-game-jam-edition\/goty-2021-game-jam-edition\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\" noopener\"  >The Game Curator<\/a><br><br>“All of this surreal oddity and foreboding doom gives There Swings a Skull a very different feel from most horror games.... the town is the monster – a horrifying sun-baked purgatory that has no escape. Madness and death are the only things that flourish there and it looks like you’re headed towards one or the other.
