One of the crowning achievements of America’s Transcontinental Railroad, the crossing of Sherman Hill was built in the early 1860s and ever since has been a mecca of American railroading at its best. Throughout the decades, Sherman Hill, with its tough 1.5 percent westbound grade across the Laramie Mountains, has been home to Union Pacific’s biggest and best motive power, from the fabled Big Boy of the steam era to today’s third-generation, high-horsepower diesels hauling double stacks, autos, manifest freight, coal, and more.<br><br>With the Train Sim World 2 Sherman Hill route, you’ll climb aboard Union Pacific’s modern and potent 4,300-horsepower Electro-Motive SD70ACe and veteran 3,000-horsepower EMD SD40-2 to forward tonnage between sprawling yards at Cheyenne and Laramie.
