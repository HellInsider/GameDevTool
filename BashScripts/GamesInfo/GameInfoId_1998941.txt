Widely renowned for its extraordinary western desert scenery, the Cane Creek Subdivision extends from a connection with Union Pacific’s Green River Subdivision at Brendel, Utah south to Potash, Utah, 35.8 route miles. As created for Train Sim World 2, the route also includes a five-mile section of the Green River Subdivision east from Brendel to Thompson, Utah.<br><br>The Cane Creek Subdivision offers heavy-haul, tough American railroading at its best. From Potash to Brendel, the line climbs nearly a thousand feet in elevation over a “roller coaster” profile featuring frequent gradients of 1.2 percent, curves of up to 6 degrees, and a journey through 7,059-foot-long Bootlegger Tunnel. The Cane Creek Branch is a rail line that requires big diesels and lots of horsepower, and you’ll take the throttle of the Union Pacific’s General Electric AC4400CW and Electro-Motive SD40-2 diesels as are included with the route.<br><br>By American railroad standards, the Cane Creek Branch is a newcomer, opened in 1962 by Union Pacific predecessor D&amp;RGW to serve a sprawling potash mine facility at Potash. You’ll handle potash line-haul and switching duties, and you’ll also climb aboard Union Pacific’s big six-axle diesels to handle the railroad’s noted “dirty dirt trains” which lug contaminated mine tailings from Moab to Brendel.<br><br>Choose how you want to play: Operate trains, ride around as a conductor, complete the route tasks, or simply pick a vantage point and watch the action unfold.
