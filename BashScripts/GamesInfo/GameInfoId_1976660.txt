content in the game can be limited \/ almost entirely removed per player preference.\r\n\r\nThe game contains no sexually explicit content \r\n\r\nThe game contains some language that some players may find offensive. (No hate speech. Just the use of sware words.)\r\n\r\nThe game allows the player to make choices and at times the player can choose to make the choice to use violence.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure a fun and enjoyable gameplay experience for a wider audience of responsible adults, content choices are offered to minimize these aspects of the game. \r\n\r\nMinimized elements may still appear in the game, this is NOT parental controls,  it is simply about being accommodating to player preferences\/sensitivities by allowing players to reduce the offensive content to minimal\/low levels. \r\n\r\nPlayers may choose to minimize the use of offensive language and or minimize the use of violent content.\r\n\r\nThe option to minimize offensive language replaces many of the swear words that are used with less offensive words or descriptive words. \r\n\r\nThe option to minimize the use of violent content removes a number of options during the game where the player could otherwise choose to use violence. \r\n\r\nOne indirect reference to self-harm can be found in the game. The player can possibly uncover a piece of information showing that one of the characters at some point in the past contemplated self-harm,   Finding it is not required and you have to go snooping to find it."}}}}
