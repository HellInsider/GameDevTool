The game is seen from an overhead view. Levels consist of rooms that you must clear of all enemies. You are constantly being chased by the enemies and you must always be on the move, running around and sidestepping to avoid being caught because getting touched by an enemy means the end. In every room bullets shoot out from the walls and you must use these bullets to vanquish all the enemies by leading them onto the path of an oncoming bullet. Clear the room of all enemies without being touched by an enemy or bullet and you pass on to the next level. As you progress through the levels enemies become faster and more difficult to avoid. The game is completely hand drawn by a professional artist. This is a work in progress in which more complex levels, enemies and more is planned for the near future through updates.","about_the_game":"You play as a boy that runs around.
