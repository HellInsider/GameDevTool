Zaydin and company go through rigorous training to master the use of their symbiote partners. They must overcome numerous obstacles and fight enemies far beyond their control, all while dealing with the emotions that come with being teenagers. The race is on for the survival of mankind in this grueling war with another world!<br><br><br>Zayden is a young, complicated teen, resisting an evil entity's attempt at controlling his mind, dealing with the loss of his mother, and fighting the war of the worlds against the alien symbiote's invasion. He attends the Symbiote Combat and Research (SCAR) Institute for his education and advanced training; SCAR’s principal, Neolinus, is Zayden’s guarding, per his dying mother’s request. Though Neolinus means well, he has no parenting skills, and the orphan finds it difficult to relate to him. Zaydin’s ego and bad temper constantly get him into trouble. Whether it’s his caretaker, the Class S president Alastair, or even his own “friends”, Zaydin acts out and antagonizes everyone around him. The question is if he is he doing it because he’s a bully, or for some other reason...<br><br>Elliosa and Kadin, the friends Zaydin never wanted, are very different when it comes to their opinion on him.

These vastly different teens are forced together to form a team. The three are joined by their individual symbiote partners. Tama belongs to Zaydin, Pinkie is Elliosa's lovable friend, and Spike is the &quot;tough guy&quot; who sticks with Kadin.

The main protagonist, Zaydin, is rebellious towards SCAR Institute and his caretaker, Principal Neolinus. Zaydin must go through this war of the worlds while dealing with his emotions, repressed memories, &quot;friendship&quot; with Elliosa, rivalry with Kadin, an unintentional friendship, and a dark evil presence dead set on controlling his mind. The war that wages between Earth and the symbiote planet, Metamor, threatens to destroy everything, forcing the children of Earth to rise up and protect the planet; however, another looming threat could undo all that the school has done to protect the planet.
