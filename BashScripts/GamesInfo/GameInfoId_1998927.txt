With a step-change in capacity and performance and sporting dual-voltage capability, the Class 313s revolutionised rail travel in the Capital, and sister units would also go onto serve East London, Merseyside and Strathclyde commuter networks.<br><br>The 313s continued their North London service until 2010, by which point London Overground had replaced them with all new Class 378 Captialstars. Instead of facing scrap though, an opportunity was taken to refurbish 19 members of the fleet and send them to Southern, offering a much-needed capacity boost.

With the withdrawal of their Great Northern counterparts, and the retirement of the Class 483 on the Isle of Wight, the Southern Class 313s are now the oldest EMUs in service in the country.
