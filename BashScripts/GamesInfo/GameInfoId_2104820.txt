Are you a fan of dungeon delving, character building, roguelikes, items, and experience? Do you enjoy popular MOBAs with their fun stat and combat systems but long for a cooperative and friendly PvE alternative? Then LL&amp;L might be for you!<br><br>Like many rogue-likes, LL&amp;L is run-based, which means certain progress is retained on a session-to-session basis. Upon death, players lose their items and the generated world is lost. However, LL&amp;L's core design revolves around building your character throughout runs. Players retain their character's attributes, skills, crafting knowledge, and ability enhancements. Not a second of gameplay is wasted, as all of your efforts will build to result in a game-breakingly overpowered character to wow your friends and explore deeper into the dungeon!<br><br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/2104820\/extras\/title-05.png?t=1660769293\" \/><br>Players can create any number of characters, but must choose one for each run. For the duration of this character's existence, its stats will be built upon and improved through gameplay. Characters can be one of three classes, Melee, Ranged, and Magic.

Skills are tied closely to the crafting system, and are used to regulate which resources and crafting diagrams the player is able to utilize.

Shards can also be imbued to weapon slot items to enhance the player's basic ability, but this effect would obviously be lost at the end of the run.
