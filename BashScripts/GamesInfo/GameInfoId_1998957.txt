More would be introduced in 1984, making a total of 23 locomotives to serve the Rhaetian Railway’s core network. In 1997, the Ge 4\/4 II fleet was permitted to work along the famed Arosa Line, as the 25 km mountain railway was converted to the same overhead system as the rest of the RhB network. The Ge 4\/4 II’s power output was ideal for the sharp grades and ever-growing traffic, and they would easily transport passengers and freight throughout the valley.<br><br>While the standard RhB red livery is applied across the fleet, multiple locomotives instead carry promotional designs that celebrate the long heritage of the nation’s railway network.

For additional variety, RhB’s white and yellow observation coach is included.
