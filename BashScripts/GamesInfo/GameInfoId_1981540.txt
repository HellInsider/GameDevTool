Enemy missiles and radar bases track your movements, and the landscape is as treacherous as your enemies.","supported_languages":"English","reviews":"“It succeeds in being immensely playable yet very difficult and horribly addictive. Nice touches include a large number of radar scanners which constantly rotate as you fly over them. These are worth more than points, for unless you blow them up, they collect data about your flight plan and enable missiles and enemy paratroopers to track you more successfully.”<br \/>\r\n93% – Computer and Video Games (April 1983)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n“Great graphics, super sound... and almost impossible to beat. This version of the Scramble-type arcade space game is one of the best so far.”<br \/>\r\n80% – Home Computing Weekly (March 15, 1983)<br \/>\r\n","header_image":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1981540\/header.jpg?t=1652793146","website":null,"pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 50 MB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 10 MB available space<\/li><\/ul>"},"mac_requirements":[],"linux_requirements":[],"developers":["Beam Software"],"publishers":["Pixel Games UK"],"price_overview":{"currency":"RUB","initial":6100,"final":6100,"discount_percent":0,"initial_formatted":"","final_formatted":"61 pуб."},"packages":[715407],"package_groups":[{"name":"default","title":"Buy Penetrator","description":"","selection_text":"Select a purchase option","save_text":"","display_type":0,"is_recurring_subscription":"false","subs":[{"packageid":715407,"percent_savings_text":" ","percent_savings":0,"option_text":"Penetrator - 61 pуб.","option_description":"","can_get_free_license":"0","is_free_license":false,"price_in_cents_with_discount":6100}]}],"platforms":{"windows":true,"mac":false,"linux":false},"categories":[{"id":2,"description":"Single-player"},{"id":1,"description":"Multi-player"},{"id":49,"description":"PvP"},{"id":37,"description":"Shared\/Split Screen PvP"},{"id":24,"description":"Shared\/Split Screen"},{"id":23,"description":"Steam Cloud"},{"id":17,"description":"Includes level editor"}],"genres":[{"id":"1","description":"Action"}],"screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1981540\/ss_c05778c6d45fe5b1f7b0d5dc72660177fb642ee6.600x338.jpg?t=1652793146","path_full":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1981540\/ss_c05778c6d45fe5b1f7b0d5dc72660177fb642ee6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652793146"},{"id":1,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1981540\/ss_746dce95ac635b4b9e448ae2d00e2255cbeb0723.600x338.jpg?t=1652793146","path_full":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1981540\/ss_746dce95ac635b4b9e448ae2d00e2255cbeb0723.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652793146"},{"id":2,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1981540\/ss_964f3ca00ed4fa98b57fd19423b14cd151c28ec8.600x338.jpg?t=1652793146","path_full":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1981540\/ss_964f3ca00ed4fa98b57fd19423b14cd151c28ec8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652793146"},{"id":3,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1981540\/ss_8efb10d662faaec3a86d317054a1dbfd95a58167.600x338.jpg?t=1652793146","path_full":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1981540\/ss_8efb10d662faaec3a86d317054a1dbfd95a58167.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652793146"},{"id":4,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1981540\/ss_bfaa5fb5e4704987f16da50b39faef375c6058a8.600x338.jpg?t=1652793146","path_full":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1981540\/ss_bfaa5fb5e4704987f16da50b39faef375c6058a8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652793146"}],"movies":[{"id":256884394,"name":"Penetrator","thumbnail":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/256884394\/movie.293x165.jpg?t=1651565315","webm":{"480":"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/256884394\/movie480_vp9.webm?t=1651565315","max":"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/256884394\/movie_max_vp9.webm?t=1651565315"},"mp4":{"480":"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/256884394\/movie480.mp4?t=1651565315","max":"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/256884394\/movie_max.mp4?t=1651565315"},"highlight":true}],"release_date":{"coming_soon":false,"date":"17 May, 2022"},"support_info":{"url":"","email":"info@pixelgames.uk"},"background":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1981540\/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1652793146","background_raw":"https:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1981540\/page_bg_generated.jpg?t=1652793146","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null}}}}
